# Algorithm
  with some tools, follow a certain rule   
  Features of a Good Algorithm
  * Core: **Efficiency**
    $$Algorithm + Data Structures = Programs  $$
    $$(Algorithm + Data Structures) \ast Efficiency = Programs$$


## The measure of Efficency

### Algorithm Analysis
  Cost : Processing time + Storage needed  
        How to measure? How to compare?
* size the cost tend to link with size
* The worst situation
* The Ideal Model
* Turing Machine Model
   * Tape
   * Alphabet
   * Head
   * State
   * Transition Function: (q, c;d, L/R, p)
      * q: current state, and the current char is 'c'
      * d: the new char ;
      * L/R: right, left, movement;
      * p: transform its state to p;
      * if state becomes h, means stop

  * RAM: Random Access Machine
    * Register: Coded with order, and don't have limitation in total number  
    R[0], R[1], R[2], ...  
    * Each basic operation only needs constant number time
